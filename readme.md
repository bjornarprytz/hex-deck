# hex-deck

This is a prototype for a game about playing cards to place hex-tiles on a map.

Each card has a color and a structure (1-5 hex tiles, e.g. Ark Nova)

Each color (red, blue, yellow, green, blue, purple) has a corresponding ability:

- Points for unique colors adjacent
- Points for same colors adjacent
- Draw card
- Just points
- Requirement: Adjacent to ocean
- Gold

- Card Stats
  - Rarity
  - Sell / Buy Value
  - Name
  - Type
  - Effect

## Game Loop

- For round in range(5):
  - Draw hand of 5 cards
  - Play cards (cards are free)
  - if points < round.requirement:
    - Loss

- Draft another card
